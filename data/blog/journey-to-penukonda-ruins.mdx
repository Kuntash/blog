summary: Dawn bike ride to Penukonda ruins uncovers ancient structures and misty sunrise magic.

Sooo, I underestimated how cold it would be riding bike at 4 am in fucking January, I just had a raincoat on and a fucking Hawaiian shirt.

As I was about to complete my first 50 km, the road suddenly got filled with fog and I slowed down a bit, and just as I looked on my right, the sun was about to rise, and the fog was creating a layer just at the neck of the trees, it looked gorgeous.

I then rode further ahead and saw a freaking star bucks in the middle of nowhere. Had a small hot chocolate as I was freezing.

After that the road was mostly straight and I broke the 120 km/hr mark. I reached the base of the hill by 8:20 am and riding to the top was really fun. It reminded me of home although the curves were steeper. Looking from above, the bends kind of look like a large anaconda, maybe that's why "Penukonda"? I know jack shit about Telugu but thats my conspiracy theory.

Going further ahead of the viewpoint, there were ruins with ancient buildings and all. I gotta research more about this as I wanna know how old these structures are. Plus the walls had words carved on the stones. I was alone and got scared so I didn't go all the way obviously.

Unlike other places I have been to, this place hasn't been monitised. Probably because it's not known widely and the only reason the roads are this good is because there is a fucking quarry and excavation site nearby.

This getaway felt really nice , and as I am writing this I can see a train moving towards its destination on the plains and it's really peaceful. 

As I take a hit of my vape and get ready to move, I hope to visit many such places this year. 

Signing off.
