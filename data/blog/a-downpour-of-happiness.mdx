Usually our lives are a set of routines with sprinkles of joys here and there. These pieces of joys can be: going out to drink, watching a comedy set or shopping. But rarely at times, a person enters your life and brings with them a downpour of happiness that makes you go "ufff". They act as a multiplier of fun and the root cause of it. They make the harsh traffic of BLR bearable,
they get rid of your insomnia, they make losing your watch fun and they create memories for a lifetime.

But then they leave, or you do and so you wait for the next adventure with a heavy heart. I am grateful to have met such an amazing person, she makes life feel more vivid, more HDR and most importantly, she makes it worth living.
