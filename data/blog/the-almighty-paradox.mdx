Once there was a being, and then all of us  
he was almighty, or so the forefathers told us  
for all the miracles he was responsible,  
for the tragedies he was all but available

We starved, we fought and we lost  
all he was at the time was a ghost  
maybe thats why ghosts are scary  
because it reminds us of a fairy

We survived, we settled and we got peace  
but then it was all because of him  
how can an almighty  
be nothing but greedy

When questioned how the miracles were performed  
they got murdered, they got silenced  
because the greatest vice was  
asking to repeat it twice.

Variants of this almighty, have mentioned a place called heaven  
Its white, its pristine, its everything you imagined  
and so the beings of this heavenly earth, you, me and us  
wait to die to reach this never seen place  
so we can enjoy after death, when we could have done that on earth

We pray half our live, we worry the other half  
just so we get an audience  
with almighty, the holy boy  
Or rather the thief of joy.
