A home, a friend and a teacher, my mother has been all three for me since the time I was a little kid to now when I am a grown adult. As I continue my adulthood, life feels overwhelming talking to people who have seen only pieces of me, and I can't help but long to be with my mum who has seen me go through everything. From the time I was a kid, she fought for me when I was getting bullied, she beat me when I was upto my naughty shit, she made me study when I would have preferred jumping from ledges, and as I grew, she did too.

She got me my first drink, she gave me the freedom to try out life with the safety net to come back when I am tired, frustrated or sick of it. Being her son is a matter of pride for me, and while she was nurturing me, I saw her grow everyday too, from working on waste recycling, painting our walls, decorating auditoriums, creating cute plushies, phone charms, knitting scarfs and table cloth to teaching kids, using zoom, using google classroom and watching k dramas. And so I want to see her happy, I want her to enjoy life, I want her to see me get married, I want her to travel around, I want her to do everything she sacrificed for me when she was young, around my age. And I would hate to see her smile go away, and I would hate for her to feel like the world isn't great anymore, after all she is my world and she is greatttttt. So I guess I will try my best to be her home, her friend, maybe not teacher? I can teach her what Typescript is tho.
